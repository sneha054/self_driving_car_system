"# self_driving_car_system" 
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a self-driving cars system that enhances autonomous driving capabilities using advanced computer vision techniques. It utilizes YOLO for obstacle detection and OpenCV for lane detection, providing detailed analysis of static images and videos to improve vehicle navigation and decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Obstacle Detection:** Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect and localize objects in static images, identifying vehicles, animals, pedestrians, and other obstacles with precise bounding box coordinates.
- **Lane Detection:** Employs OpenCV to process images and videos for detecting lane markings, assisting autonomous vehicles in maintaining lane discipline.
- **Data Analysis:** Provides comprehensive analysis of static images of obstacles and lane data to support vehicle navigation and decision-making processes.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
- **OpenCV**
- **Python**
- ### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
