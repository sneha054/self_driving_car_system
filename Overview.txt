Overview Workflow
Set Up Environment:

Install required packages using requirements.txt.
Set up the project directory structure.
Prepare Data:

Collect and organize static images and videos for obstacle and lane detection.
Store them in the data/ directory.
Implement Obstacle Detection:

Develop a script obstacle_detection.py to use YOLO for detecting obstacles in static images.
Implement Lane Detection:

Develop a script lane_detection.py to use OpenCV for detecting lanes in images and videos.
Combine Detection Methods:

Create a main.py script to integrate both obstacle and lane detection.
Test and Validate:

Run the scripts on sample data to ensure they work as expected.
Validate the results and make necessary adjustments.
Document the Project:

Update the README.md with project details, usage instructions, and dependencies.
